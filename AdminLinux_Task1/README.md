~~System-wide documentation system that provides short reference manuals (pages) for individual

>What is the difference between rm and rmdir using man command?

rm is for remove file or directory

![rm command](photos/12.png
"")

rmdir is for remove only  emptty direcories

![rmdir command](photos/13.png
"")

>Create the following hierarchy under your home directory:

![dir1 folder](photos/14.png
"")

![docs folder](photos/15.png
"")

![Documents folder](photos/16.png
"")

>Remove dir11 with rmdir in one-step. What did you notice? And how did you
overcome that?

we cannot use rmdir because file is not empty so we use rm 

![rm dir11](photos/17.png
"")

>remove OldFiles using rmdir â€“p command. State what happened to the
hierarchy (Note: you are in your home directory).

The command rmdir -p  is used to remove directories, and the -p flag allows it to remove parent directories if they are empty. However, and OldFiles is actually a file rather than a directory, running this command will result in an error.

![rm OldFiles](photos/18.png
"")
to solve it i used: 
>rm ~/Documents/OldFiles

>The output of the command pwd was /home/yasmeen. Write the absolute and
relative path for the file mycv

Absolute Path: /home/yasmeen/docs

Relative Path: docs

![pwd](photos/19.png

>Copy the /etc/passwd file to your home directory making its name is mypasswd

![password](photos/20.png
"")
>Rename this new file to be oldpasswd

![old password](photos/21.png
